# Summary

# The reduce() function applies the fn function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of the list, from left to right, to reduce the list into a single value.

# Unlike the map() and filter() functions, the reduce() isnâ€™t a built-in function in Python. In fact, the reduce() function belongs to the functools module.

# To use the reduce() function, you need to import it from the functools

# A list comprehension consists of the following parts:

# An input list (numbers)
# A variable that represents the elements of the list (number)
# An output expression (number**2) that returns the elements of the output list from the elements of the input list.
